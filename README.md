# Azure Machine Learning Gallery</h2>

Azure Machine Learning Gallery enables our growing community of developers and data scientists to share their machine learning pipelines, components, etc. to accelerate productivity in the machine learning lifecycle.

In this gallery, you can easily find a machine learning pipeline/component which is similar to the problem you are trying to solve, rather than starting from scratch.

## Quick Links
* [Pipelines](/pipelines/README.md) - highlights of end to end machine learning workflows in multipe domains like text analytics, computer vision, recommendation, etc.
* [Components](/components/README.md) - a catalog of components which can be reused in different pipelines
