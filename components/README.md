# Component gallery
In this directory, you will find a wide array of components that can be used in Azure Machine Learning, contributed by Microsoft and open source community. 

## Components
A component is self-contained set of code that performs one step in the ML workflow (pipeline), such as data preprocessing, model training, model scoring and so on. A component is analogous to a function, in that it has a name, parameters, expects certain input and returns some value. Data scientists or developers can wrap their arbitrary code as Azure Machine Learning component by following the component specification. Find the [tutorials](../tutorial) to get started.

Following are some available components in the gallery.

| Scenario |Description |
| --- | --- |
|[Simple Algorithm for Recommendation (SAR)*](../pipelines/sar-pipeline/README.md) | An example of how to train, score and evaluate an SAR recommender using the Azure Machine Learning component. </br> This scenario contains the following components: </br> [Stratified Splitter](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/stratified_splitter.yaml): split dataset into training dataset and test dataset. </br> [SAR Training](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/sar_train.yaml): Train a simple algorithm recommender. </br> [SAR Scoring](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/sar_score.yaml): using test dataset to score the trained recommender. </br> [MAP](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/map.yaml): Mean Average Precision at K metric. </br> [nDCG](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/ndcg.yaml): Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) at K metric. </br> [Precision at K](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/precision_at_k.yaml): Precision at K metric. </br> [Recall at K](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/recall_at_k.yaml): Recall at K metric. 
|[Spectral Residual Anomaly Detection](../pipelines/ad-pipeline/README.md)| Anomaly detection aims to discover unexpected events or rare items in data. It is designed to be accurate, efficient and general, using Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
| [Text classification using CNN](../pipelines/textcnn-pipeline/README.md) | An example of how to train, and score a CNN sentiment classifier using combination of Designer built-in modules and components. </br> This scenario contains the following components:</br> [textCNN Train Model](./text-cnn/textcnn-train/train.yaml) </br> [textCNN Score Model](./text-cnn/textcnn-score/score.yaml) </br> [TextCNN Word to Id](./text-cnn/textcnn-preprocess/preprocess.yaml) </br> 
| [Compute Correlation](./compute_correlation/compute_correlation_component.yaml) | Compute correlation matrix of pairwise columns in dataset using kendall, spearman, pearson methods. 
| [Image classification using AML labeling data](../pipelines/labeling-image-classification-pipeline/README.md) | This example use AML labeling dataset as training dataset of image classification. The pipeline contains one custom component [Convert Labeling Data to Image Directory](./convert-labeling-data-to-image-directory/convert_labeling_data_to_image_directory.spec.yaml) and several Designer built-in modules. 
| Natural Language Processing | There are following sample components in NLP scenario: </br> [Detect languages](./detect_languages/languages_component.yaml): Detect languages on text columns in a dataset. </br> [Semantic Textual Similarity](./semantic_textual_similarity/sts_component.yaml) </br> [Sequence Embedding](./sequence_embedding/sgt_train_component.yaml): Model sequence data by extracting short/long term sequence features and generate emebedding in finite-dimensional space. </br> [Score Sequence Embeddings](./sequence_embedding/sgt_score_component.yaml): Apply sequence embeddings to score data using transformation state from training dataset. |

## Create new component in your workspace

In the Azure Machine Learning studio portal, you can create new component in your workspace and use it in the designer.
1. Go to **Modules** asset page.
1. Click on **New Module** and select **From Yaml file**.
1. Input the component spec URL and Click **Next**
1. Follow the guidance to finish your creation. And You could find your new components under **Custom Module** in the module list of Designer.
